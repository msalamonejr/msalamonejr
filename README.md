### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Mike and I am a Loss Prevention Professional looking to break into the Cybersecurity Industry. I enjoy puzzles and finding out ways to solve problems. This has driven me to have a successful career in Loss Prevention and I will be using this drive to jump-start my career in Cybersecurity. I recently completed the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate course and am currently working on my CompTia Security+ certificate.
